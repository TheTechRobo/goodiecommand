# goodiecommand
 Making commands simpler for novices

# Installing goodiecommand
All you do is run `chmod +x installGoodCommands` and then `sudo bash installGoodCommands` in the terminal and it should install..

# What does goodiecommand do
goodiecommand basically installs currently 4 commands that link to others — `rsync -aE`, `emacs batch -l dunnet`, `rm -rfi`, and `sudo apt update && sudo apt install` for now.

# Is it a virus? 
thetechrobo@outlook.com. That's my email. Do you think I'd be giving you my email if this was malware? Yes it looks bad because it installs in /usr/bin but examine /usr/bin and my scripts before and after installing... I guarantee there is no malware.

# Why should I get it?
If you are new to Linux I highly recommend this if you are planning on using the terminal as instead of commands like `rm -i index.html` there's `delete index.html`.

# Contributing
If you have a command you use lots and would like a shortcut included in goodiecommand please file a feature request OR code it yourself. 

#  Word of warning
`install` will only work on Debian-based package systems. (In case you don't know what that is, type `apt` in the terminal. If it says "apt: command not found" or similar, you (probably) don't have a Debian package system. If it shows a long list of stuff, you have a Debian package system.

Thanks for using!
