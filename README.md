# Installing goodiecommand
All you do is run `chmod +x install.sh` and then `sudo bash install.sh` in the terminal and it should install.  
If it gives you any errors, go to my [support](https://github.com/thetechrobo/support) repo and leave an Issue there BEFORE leaving an issue here. These Issues are reserved for known bugs.

# What does it do?
goodiecommand basically installs currently 4 commands that link to others â€” `rsync -aE`, `emacs batch -l dunnet`, `rm -rfi`, and `sudo apt update && sudo apt install` for now.

# Is it a virus? 
thetechrobo@outlook.com. That's my email. Do you think I'd be giving you my email if this was malware? Yes it looks bad because it installs in /usr/bin but examine /usr/bin and my scripts before and after installing... I guarantee there is no malware.

# Why should I get it?
**YOU SHOULD NOT: IT MAY OVERWRITE SYSTEM FILES AND ON TOP OF THAT IT'S OUTDATED AND NOT TESTED ENOUGH**

If you are new to Linux I highly recommend this if you are planning on using the terminal as instead of commands like `rm -i index.html` there's `delete index.html`.

# Contributing
If you have a command you use lots and would like a shortcut included in goodiecommand please file a feature request OR code it yourself. 

#  Word of warning
`install` will only work on Debian-based package systems. (In case you don't know what that is, type `dpkg` in the terminal. If it says "dpkg: command not found" or similar, you don't have a Debian package system. If it shows a long list of stuff, you most likely have a Debian package system.
