# goodiecommand
 Making commands simpler for novices



# Installing goodiecommand
All you do is run `chmod +x installGoodCommands' and then `sudo bash installGoodCommands' and it should install

# What does goodiecommand do?
goodiecommand basically installs currently 3 commands that link to others â€” `rsync -aE', `emacs batch -l dunnet', and `rm -rfi' for now.

# Is it a virus? 
thetechrobo@outlook.com. That's my email. Do you think I'd be giving you my email if this was malware? Yes it looks bad because it installs in /usr/bin but examine /usr/bin and my scripts before and after installing... I guarantee there is no malware.

# Why should I get it?
If you are new to Linux I highly recommend this if you are planning on using the terminal as instead of commands like `rm -Rfi index.html' there's `delete index.html'.

# Contributing
If you have a command you use lots and would like a shortcut included in goodiecommand please file a feature request OR code it yourself. 

Thanks for using!
